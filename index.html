        <img src="./img/20.png" alt="news 8">
        <p>Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will take on the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in the IPL 2023 on Thursday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. The Aiden Markram-led side will hope to carry forward their winning run after defeating Delhi Capitals in their last game.</p>
        <p>They had earlier lost to DC in Hyderabad as the batters buckled under the pressure from the bowlers and SRH fell short of the 145-run target by 7 runs in the end. But SRH avenged the loss by defeating DC by 9 runs in Delhi and getting a much-needed win under their belt while also ensuring they don’t drop to the bottom of the table.</p>
        <p>Abhishek Sharma laid the platform with an aggressive 67-run innings while Heinrich Klaasen provided the finishing touches with a brisk 53 off 27 balls to help SRH post a competitive 197/6. Mayank Markande then produced an excellent spell of 2/20 in four overs as the SRH bowlers held their nerve and survived Phil Salt (59 off 35) and Mitchell Marsh's blitzes (63 off 39) to break their three-match losing streak.</p>

        <img src="./img/13.png" alt="9">
        <p>Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will take on Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the IPL 2023 on Thursday at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad. KKR will look to get back to winning ways after enduring a heavy loss against Gujarat Titans in their last game. Having lost six and won three of their nine matches, KKR are currently placed eighth in the points table.</p>
        <p>SRH had blown KKR away in the previous outing with Harry Brook scoring a ton as Nitish Rana and Co. fell short by 23 runs while chasing 228 at home. However, Brook has failed to replicate the same going forward and could well be dropped from the XI.</p>
        <p>Coming back to the KKR setup, Jason Roy missed the previous game with a back spasm but will be back into the side if he is deemed match fit. The England cricketer has been a revelation for KKR after being drafted in as a replacement player for Shreyas Iyer and Shakib-Al-Hasan. He mustered 160 runs in six matches, which includes two half-centuries.</p>

        <img src="./img/20.png" alt="10">
        <p>It has been three days since Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir clashed after an IPL 2023 match between Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bangalore at the Ekana Stadium but interest around it refuses to die. Such was the unexpectedness of the unpleasant sight of two noted names of Indian cricket nearly coming to blows on the cricket field that legends like Sunil Gavaskar and Virender Sehwag felt the ‘100% fine’ imposed by BCCI was not enough. They should have gotten a stricter punishment, they felt.</p>
        <p>There are different levels of offences according to the IPL Code of Conduct and for each offence or breach of the conduct, there is a defined fine. The match referee, in consultation with the on-field umpires, deemed Kohli and Gambhir's act a violation of Article 2.21 of the IPL Code of Conduct, which deals with “all types of conduct that bring the game into disrepute.”</p>
        <p>The IPL Playing Conditions further add that "the person lodging the report shall determine where on the range of severity the conduct lays." In this case, the match referee and umpires decided that Kohli and Gambhir's breach falls under Level 2 and hence, they were fined 100% of their match fees. LSG pacer Naveen-ul-Haq, who too was found breaching Article 2.21, was fined 50% of his match fee as his offence was deemed to be a Level 1.</p>

        <p>The Mumbai Indians produced an emphatic performance on Wednesday night to register their fifth win of the 2023 Indian Premier League, beating Punjab Kings by six wickets in Mohali. It was a run-fest at the PCA Stadium, with the home side posting a mammoth score of 214/3 in 20 overs; however, an incredible batting effort from Ishan Kishan (75) and Suryakumar Yadav (66) helped the Mumbai Indians to a much-needed win with seven deliveries to spare.</p>
        <p>MI endured a poor start to their run-chase, though; their captain Rohit Sharma continued to struggle with form, as he was dismissed on a duck in the first over of the match. Rishi Dhawan dismissed the MI great early in the innings to put the visitors on instant backfoot, and following the dismissal, the official Twitter account of Punjab Kings posted a rather savage tweet.</p>
        <p>In a now-deleted tweet, the PBKS cheekily wrote ‘R0’, taking a dig at Rohit for getting out on a three-ball duck. The MI skipper is fondly nicknamed ‘R0’. The tweet soon gained traction, with fans of Rohit Sharma and the MI criticising the PBKS, and soon, Mumbai Indians' official Twitter account also took notice of the tweet.</p>

Workplace stress can also affect the productivity of the organisation. With different types of jobs, the workload of the person varies, and so does the stress. “Stress can be caused by various events, for example an employee might feel under pressure if the job demands more hours or responsibilities which are more than they can manage, and this increases the stress. Various Other sources of stress can happen because of conflict with co-workers or bosses, constant change in profile or threat to job security etc,” said Dr Rahul Dilip Jagtap, Clinical Psychologist, Ruby Hall Clinic, Pune, in an interview with HT Lifestyle.</p>
        <p>Adding to the same, Dr. Mehezabin Dordi, Clinical Psychologist, Rehabilitation and Sports Medicine, at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital and Research Centre, Mumbai further said that workplace stress can have both positive and negative impact. “If you can harness the positive aspect of stress, it can become a motivating factor and help you achieve your goals,” the expert commented.</p>
